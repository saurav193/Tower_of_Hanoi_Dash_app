### Description
This is a simple Dash app to play the tower of hanoi game. The game is a simple application of stacks in the backend of a dashboard. The game can be played from the link [here](). Also you can clone/download the repo and run the app.py script to play the game.

Rules of the game are:

- Start the game from the Left Tower with the required number of disks. Aim is to move all the disks to the Right Tower.
- Only a *lower* value disk can be placed on top of a *higher* value disk. Only 1 disk can be moved in any move.
- Try to complete the game in minimum number of moves
- The optimum number of moves is shown in "Min Moves" which depends on the number of disks.
